## Ares
With their global headquarters in nearby Detroit, Toronto and its access to the Saint Lawrence is a valuable logistics asset for Ares. From their North American Distribution Facility in the Core, Ares’ Toronto operation coordinates the defense giant’s shipping operations across the western hemisphere. The local ops director, Felicia Koritz, has aligned herself with Arthur Vogel’s faction within the splintering mega, causing a great deal of strife between Toronto and Damien Knight’s stronghold in Detroit. 

Ares’s private security firm Knight Errant held the Toronto police contract from 2058 to 2070. Knight Errant continues to operate a cybernetics proving ground in [Durham](regions.md).

## Aztechnology
Bandwagoning onto Shiawase’s Urban Ag initiative, Aztechnology’s presence in Toronto is most felt through their aggressive investing and buyouts of biotech startups and their construction of GroTowers across the northwest fringes of the sprawl. Aztech subsidiaries are also heavily involved in the city’s media business and low income housing developments in Peel and West York.

## Horizon
The big daddy of media companies, Horizon has been digging deep into the Toronto entertainment scene in an attempt to uproot it and the smaller production houses propping it up to transplant back to their base in Los Angeles. When they’re not working on consolidating their media monopoly, Horizon is working on a number of urban development projects within the sprawl under the codename Project Babel. 

## Shiawase
Investing early and digging deep, Shiawase has its tendrils all over the sprawl. Shiawase either owns or holds maintenance contracts for approximately 53% of the city power grid, as well as both the Pickering Fusion Plant. Shiawase has also invested heavily into the Toronto biotech industry including advances in urban agriculture and hydroponics as well as research into living clothes and building materials grown from proprietary gene modded plants.

## Wuxing
Limited mostly to operations around the Durham port area and their offices in the Core, Wuxing is currently looking to expand their operations within the city. As part of this effort, they’ve undergone a big PR push throughout the city, helping provide much needed public facilities in Chinatown and donating large sums of money to local policlubs and Awakened societies. So far the effort seems to have paid off, with Wuxing opening a magical research facility sponsored by the GTEC, FARI, and the Illuminates of the New Dawn, as well as a new partnership between the megacorporation and the Dominion Group’s financial division.

## Dominion Group
Originally created out of a merger between the Toronto Dominion and CIBC banks, the Dominion Group is a Toronto based AA corp specializing in finance, matrix services, resource extraction, and consumer products. While they may not have the power and reach the AAA megas do, Toronto is their city. Aggressive and more willing to take short term losses for long term gain than most corps, the Dominion Group has been waging a campaign of economic warfare against Aztechnology’s matrix services division within the city while partnering with Wuxing and Ares to give it the AAA cred to deal with a suit through the Corporate Court.

## Argus Security
A Cincinnati based AA security firm, Argus currently holds the Toronto Metroplex Policing Contract. Easily distinguishable by their navy blue and silver uniforms and vehicles, Argus is heavily preferential to drones and automated security systems, allowing them to cut the total number of officers they employ compared to other policing companies like Lonestar and Knight Errant. Argus operates 82 police precincts across the sprawl, as well as officer training facilities in Peel and Hamilton.
