        <p>While law enforcement in Toronto is generally stricter than most other places in the UCAS, that isn’t really saying much. The city is divided up into zones with security graded on a scale from A to F. A grade security zones (the Business District in the Core, high income neighborhoods, etc.) are controlled by local security through checkpoints, patrolling officers and automated surveillance systems.

<h2 id="argus-security">Argus Security<a href="#argus-security" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The main security contractor for the Toronto Metroplex is Argus Security. Efficient and businesslike, Argus does its best in areas where it knows shareholders and the <a href="politics">GTEC</a> will be watching while it slacks off more in poorer areas. Some have accused the security contractor of violence and discrimination against Awakened, citing multiple incidents where Argus officers have used extreme, often lethal, force when dealing with magic users.</p>
