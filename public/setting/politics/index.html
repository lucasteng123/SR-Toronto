        <p>In 2031, the Toronto Metropolitan Consolidation Act was passed by the Ontario State Government and ratified by a majority of constituents, officially folding the surrounding regions of Peel, York, Durham, and Halton into the City of Toronto as districts. The City of Hamilton and the STAR City Arkoblock Complex were both added later.</p>
<p>Each district is divided up into wards that each elect two members to serve  on their district’s council. The members of each district council appoint  representatives to serve on the Greater Toronto Executive Council. The GTEC is comprised of 15 members (2 reps from each district plus a special representative appointed by the mayor of Toronto) and has ultimate executive authority over the sprawl.</p>
<p>The current Mayor of Toronto is Jordan Hodge, a staunch technocrat whose tax credits for small companies have kickstarted a vibrant startup culture in the city.</p>
<p>Toronto is also home to the Ontario state government.</p>
