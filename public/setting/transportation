More than 130 kilometers from end to end, the Toronto sprawl is big. Luckily, the city has a well developed road network (integrated with Gridguide 3.11) as well as dedicated air travel lanes for drones, helicopters and VTOL craft. 

For public transit- GO Transit operates a number of high speed commuter rails and buses with stops throughout the city. A one way ticket costs a few nuyen, and a monthly pass will run you about ¥200. For service around the Core, there’s also TTC subways and trolleys which are slightly cheaper but slower and more geographically limited.

If public transit isn’t your speed, taxis can be found idling in basically any populated area. Usually painted in a recognizable scheme of orange and green, taxis charge about ¥1.50 per kilometer. If you’re a real highroller, you can arrange for a helitaxi ahead of time, with prices starting at ¥300 per person.

Union Station in the Core is the best one stop shop for transit if you happen to be vehicularly challenged. Both public and private transportation schemes base themselves in or around the old rail station, and if you’re looking to travel over land outside the city, you can use the station to catch trains bound for all corners of North America.

For air travel, look east to Peel and Pearson International Airport (YYZ). One of the busiest airports in the UCAS, more than 60 million passengers travel through YYZ every single year.

A much smaller airport resides just south of The Core, where once a small commercial airline operated, but failed in the early 2030s. Billy Bishop, classified YTZ, is exclusively used for private air travel, where executives and the mega-rich fly their ostentatious craft into the city, and store them in the very public-facing, all glass hangars on the city side of the airport.
